## Why build a blog?

It's time to share what you know!

## What to consider?

Important to consider when creating a blog:

-   Goals and purpose
-   Values
-   Valuable and relevant content
-   Workflows and maintenance
-   Technical stuff, too!

## :x invisible {#x-invisible}

We're not going to be going too in depth on internal blogs at organizations today, but there are other things to note for those types of blogs.

-   Buy-in and ownership
-   Guardrails
-   Norms and feedback

Watch my previous talk, [Building a blog with R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrW5XFf7aps), to hear me go into detail about these considerations.
