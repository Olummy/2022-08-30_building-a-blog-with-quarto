## Literate programming with Quarto

```{r}
#| message = FALSE,
#| warning = FALSE
# I write my code here
# and I see the plot underneath.

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

palmerpenguins::penguins %>% 
  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point()
```

-   Syntax highlighting

-   Executable code

-   Reproducibility

-   Workflow

-   Control

## Do I need to use Quarto to create a blog?
