### GitHub Pages

One way of publishing to GitHub Pages is rendering the `docs` directory, check the rendered site into GitHub, and then configure your GitHub repo to publish from the docs directory.

#### `_quarto.yml`

Add project configuration:

``` yaml
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs
```

Add a `.nojekyll` file:

``` bash
touch .nojekyll
```
